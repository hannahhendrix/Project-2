Provided functions to calculate bank balances with and without monthly deposits and compiled within a display table. 

I did well creating functional code.
I had trouble getting the code to work without a significant amount of code within the main function. If I were to create more files and classes, it could enhance my code. 
I found it difficult to get the code to come out exactly as expected, particularly the asterisks.
This code would be transferable to any future banking endevors.
I made this maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding many comments, spacing things out, and creating proper variable names that were understandable and easy to read.
